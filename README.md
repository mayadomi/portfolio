# Portfolio Site

A personalised portfolio website built with concepts and learnings from the She Codes Plus HTML/CSS module.

## Website link/deployment

The site was deployed using GitHub Pages, and is available here:

https://github.mayadomi.io/portfolio

### Brief/Prerequisites

The design brief for the portfolio included the following items. 

* 1 or more profile pictures
* 100 word bio
* Preferred contact method (functional form)
* Work/projects section
* External links eg LinkedIn/GitHub
* 2 web pages
* Version controlled with Git
* Deployed on GitHub pages
* Responsive design principles
* Semantic HTML and accessibe design
* Styles for hover, active & focus
* Burger menu/javascript for mobile


### Process

The initial step to the design was to create a wireframe. This was done using Excalidraw. The design evolved from a simple wireframe to a more detailed version, and provided a blueprint to work towards.

To create the design I first browsed Upslash for an image that I liked/resonated with and eventually found the one seen in the header. The colour theme/palette I derived from the image and tried to build on that.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was learning how to position elements, and to do so without a very messy tangled result of CSS (which kind of feels like where it's now going :grimacing:)

Evolving design - as I started to develop it I began to want tweak/change the design. But to keep on track I stuck with the design at hand, with a view to let it evolve over time.

## Wishlist/improvements

This is probably a super big list if I allow myself to ponder too long, but the immediate improvements would be:

* Better responsiveness at different resolutions - particulalry the projects section, so it tiles across at bigger resolutions.
* Accessibility improvements (particularly with the white-on-orange aspect)
* The overall look/feel of the Projects section(s) - not sure exactly how I want this to look, but starting to know what I don't want.
* Incorporation of some spatial interactivity - would love to learn d3 or webGL to see if I could include a custom globe or map.
* Include a favicon
